tabs-in-live
============

Android application to display tabs on tablet.

The aim of this application is to read A4 tabs (or other kind of paper) and allows the user to scroll down with a single click.
I use it to read bass tab, and scroll down with my foot in studio.

This is the very beginning, so a lot of things are static, and I only test it on my own tablet.

To import tabs, the path must be: <sdcard>/tabsinlive/<concertName>/<tabName>/1 sheet.png

To order sheets, you have to name it prefixed by page number and a space. "1 my song.png, 2 my song.png"
